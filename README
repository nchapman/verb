# What is this?

Verb is a piece of Rack Middleware that serves up RHTML files.

# How do I use it?

1. Put a file ending with `.rhtml` in the root, like `hello.rhtml`
2. Put some static files in `public` if you need them.
3. Run `rackup` in the terminal where your `config.ru` files resides.
4. Open http://localhost:9292/hello/ to see your handy work in action.

# Now what?

It's based on Rack so you can run this on any web server that supports Rack like [Phusion Passenger][1] or [Thin][2].
